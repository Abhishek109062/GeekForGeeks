/*Remove Consecutive Characters 
Basic Accuracy: 55.83% Submissions: 19923 Points: 1
Given a string S delete the characters which are appearing more than once consecutively.

Example 1:

Input:
S = aabb
Output:  ab 
Explanation: 'a' at 2nd position is
appearing 2nd time consecutively.
Similiar explanation for b at
4th position.

Example 2:

Input:
S = aabaa
Output:  aba
Explanation: 'a' at 2nd position is
appearing 2nd time consecutively.
'a' at fifth position is appearing
2nd time consecutively.
 

Your Task:
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function removeConsecutiveCharacter() which accepts a string as input parameter and returns modified string.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|).
 

Constraints:
1<=|S|<=105
All characters are lowercase alphabets.
